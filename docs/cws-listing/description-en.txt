Lexato - Digital Evidence Registry

Capture and certify digital evidence with legal validity using blockchain and advanced cryptography. Lexato is the professional tool for lawyers, forensic experts, investigators, and anyone who needs to preserve digital evidence securely and with legal validity.


WHAT IS LEXATO?

Lexato is a digital evidence capture and certification platform that transforms any online content into legally valid evidence. Through cutting-edge cryptography, blockchain technology, and compliance with international standards, Lexato ensures your captures are admissible in legal proceedings.

Lexato's differentiator is its complete digital chain of custody: each captured piece of evidence receives a SHA-256 cryptographic hash, is organized into a Merkle Tree, and is certified on public blockchain networks (Polygon, Arbitrum, or Optimism), creating an immutable and verifiable record of the evidence's existence at a specific point in time.


KEY FEATURES

- Screenshot capture with complete forensic metadata
  Capture any web page with automatic recording of URL, title, timestamp, IP, geolocation, reverse DNS, WHOIS, and Wayback Machine record.

- Video recording with forensic browsing log
  Record your browsing session on video with a complete log of all pages visited during the recording, creating a detailed forensic log.

- Blockchain certification
  Each piece of evidence is certified on public blockchain networks (Polygon, Arbitrum, or Optimism), ensuring an immutable and verifiable record.

- SHA-256 hashing and Merkle Tree
  Advanced cryptographic technology to guarantee the integrity of each captured piece of evidence. Any modification to the file invalidates the hash.

- Digital evidence reports
  Generate complete PDF certificates with all forensic metadata, hash, cryptographic signature, and verification code.

- Side panel recording controls
  Video recording controls outside the captured area, allowing free browsing without interfering with the video.


USE CASES

- Evidence for legal proceedings: Capture and preserve evidence from social media posts, websites, emails, and messages for use in lawsuits.

- Evidence preservation: Preserve web pages, documents, and digital content before they are modified or deleted.

- Compliance and auditing: Document digital processes and procedures for regulatory compliance and auditing purposes.


SECURITY AND COMPLIANCE

- ISO/IEC 27037 compliance: International standard for identification, collection, acquisition, and preservation of digital evidence.

- LGPD compliance: Personal data processing in compliance with Brazil's General Data Protection Law (Law 13,709/2018).

- Data stored in Brazil: All evidence files are stored on AWS servers in the sa-east-1 region (Sao Paulo, Brazil).

- Explicit consent: The extension only collects data when the user explicitly initiates a capture. No data is collected in the background.

- Encryption in transit: All communications use HTTPS/TLS and WebSocket Secure (WSS).
